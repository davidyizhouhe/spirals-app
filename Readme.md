This application is meant to illustrate the relation between the number of visible spirals (parastichies) on a plant, and the (constant) angle of divergence between successive primordia. 

Essentially, visual spiral patterns appear because we link the closest nodes to each other, and the succession of closest (and second closest) nodes are linked in spirals.
Why they are linked in this fashion is because of the properties of Euclidean division/the Euclidean algorithm. 

In addition, realistic models account for radial distances as well. Several radial growth models are provided, and distances between nodes can be plotted and observed.
